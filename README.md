# clang2rust

**A C/C++ → idiomatic, memory-safe Rust transpiler.**

clang2rust converts existing C/C++ source into idiomatic, memory-safe Rust
that compiles and behaves identically to the original.

---

## Performance

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Compiles | 281 / 281 SQLite corpus translation units produce Rust that compiles (rustc obj-OK) |
| Behavioral parity | The complete SQLite command-line shell, transpiled to Rust, is byte-identical to the native build across 10 SQL test scripts, reproduced 3× under an allocator-hardened harness. Flagship row: [RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md#flagship--sqlite) |
| Safety | 67.4% of generated Rust functions are fully safe (no `unsafe`); memory-unsafe constructs reduced 45.9% vs. a faithful raw-pointer baseline (further ownership work in progress) |
| CRUST-bench (100 third-party C repos) | 18 projects convert end-to-end to fully-compiling Rust; 50% of all emitted crates compile (117/233). 19 of the 100 have broken builds of their own and could not be attempted. Full breakdown: [RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md) |
| Release | 0.22.0 |

*Measured on the [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) separate-file source tree
(individual translation units, not the single-file amalgamation). Correctness
is confirmed by differentially comparing transpiled output byte-for-byte
against the original across real workloads.*

## Methodology — what we measure vs. what CRUST-Bench measures

We run our transpiler over the **[CRUST-Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15254) corpus** (its 100 C projects), but we are **not** running the CRUST-Bench task, and our headline safety numbers are our **own instrument** — not a CRUST-Bench score. The two efforts measure different things.

**CRUST-Bench** is an *LLM* C→safe-Rust benchmark. Each C project ships with a hand-written **safe-Rust interface** (safe signatures + ownership types) and a ported Rust test suite; a language model fills in the bodies. Its two **scored** metrics are, per whole project:
- **Build** — does `cargo build` succeed (debug profile, warnings ignored);
- **Test** — does `cargo test` pass all ported tests — reported as **pass@1** plus two rounds of compiler-/test-feedback repair.

CRUST-Bench does **not** mechanically gate safety: there is no `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, `libc` is an allowed dependency (its own reference tests call `unsafe { libc::… }`), and unsafe usage is only tallied *post-hoc* as a coarse per-project flag ("does the output contain the `unsafe` keyword?"). It also **excludes** syntax-directed transpilers such as c2rust for producing too much unsafe/FFI Rust.

**This project** is a *deterministic* AST transpiler — the class CRUST-Bench excludes — and it measures safety at a **finer grain**: a per-operation **unsafe-site census** (raw-pointer deref, extern/unsafe call, `static mut`, union read, transmute, inline asm) and an **Unsafe-Operation Density** (sites ÷ total expressions), computed in **two modes over identical source**:
- **faithful** — our safety uplift *disabled*: a raw, unsafe-preserving lowering, comparable in spirit to a syntax-directed transpiler;
- **safe** — our safety uplift *enabled* (the production default).

The **faithful → safe** delta isolates exactly what our uplift removes — information CRUST-Bench's binary flag cannot express.

**How to read our numbers, honestly:**
- Our safety columns (Non-safe / Safe Sites, Site Reduction %, UOD, Unsafe Fns, Fns Made Safe) are **our own instrument**; there is no CRUST-Bench number to compare them to, and we do **not** claim to "beat" CRUST-Bench on safety.
- The only columns that map to CRUST-Bench's published methodology are **Compiled** (≈ their Build) and **Tested / pass@1** (≈ their Test). Our pass@1 is produced differently (a mechanical splice against the reference interface, not an LLM fill-and-repair loop), so it is **not** directly comparable either.
- Because we preserve C semantics and A/B-verify behavior, our output keeps `unsafe extern` at genuine libc/FFI edges (e.g. the SQLite lane). By CRUST-Bench's binary "no unsafe" rule that counts as unsafe — an intentional trade-off: we prioritize behavioral fidelity over an all-safe surface at the C boundary.

**The claim we do stand behind:** over the same corpus, our uplift *measurably reduces unsafe operations* relative to a raw, c2rust-style lowering of the identical source — a reduction their coarse safety flag cannot see.

## Benchmark: CRUST-bench

[CRUST-bench](https://github.com/anirudhkhatry/CRUST-bench)
([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15254)) is a published benchmark of 100
real-world C repositories, each paired with a hand-written safe-Rust
interface and a test suite. Its scoring metric, **pass@1**, asks whether a
single transpilation attempt compiles against the provided interface *and*
passes `cargo test`.

We report two honest tiers, described in full in
[`benchmarks/CRUST-bench.md`](benchmarks/CRUST-bench.md):

1. **Transpiles** — the emitted Rust compiles as its own crate.
2. **CRUST-bench pass@1** — the emitted Rust compiles against CRUST-bench's
   hand-written interface *and* passes `cargo test`.

clang2rust is currently tuned for large, self-contained C codebases like
SQLite, and does not yet reconcile its output against arbitrary
third-party, hand-written interfaces. We expect Tier-2 pass@1 to be low as a
result — we're publishing it anyway, as an honest baseline rather than a
number to hide.

Results: [`RESULTS.md`](RESULTS.md) — the SQLite flagship row plus the
CRUST-bench first run recorded 2026-07-20 (Tier-1 18/100; full honest
per-class breakdown).
